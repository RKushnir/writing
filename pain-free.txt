Check it out, science reckons they can make a cow that doesn't feel physical pain. Celebrate progress! We can all eat meat guilt free now, right?
I hate to storm on your parade, but that's not quite the story.

Surely, assuming battery farms have to exist, we ought to reduce the suffering of the animals in them?
This appears reasonable, but it misses a number of points.

How do you think scientists develop a pain-free cow?

bq. When the team injected a noxious, painful chemical into their paws, the mice licked them only briefly. In contrast, normal mice continued to do so for hours afterwards (Neuron, vol 36, p 713).

By inflicting pain. After mice, you work your way up the animal heirachy (each animal is different, you know) until eventually you arrive at livestock. There is a high moral cost, but also a high economic and opportunity cost - these scientists are smart guys, imagine what they could come up with if they weren't busy torturing? Furthermore, as with most science, this is an uncapped problem. Behaviour in mice is not a good indicator for behaviour in more developed animals - at this point an actual robot cow is still a long way off.

We ought to reduce suffering, but we also need to consider the cost of that reduction. Further, we need to consider the magnitude of that reduction. As evidenced by the neurotic behaviours developed by all battery farmed animals kept in confined spaces, the mental suffering of these animals is at least, if not greater, than the physical suffering. Confinement drives people crazy, it's drives animals crazy too. A pain-free cow will still suffer, strictly less than one that does feel pain [*], but the magnitude of this reduction is much less than many commentators are assuming.
