Why?
What do you care most about?

Health
* Science has repeatedly found that a standard plant based diet is healthier than your standard meat diet
* The dietary concerns your parents have are largely based on meat industry science - "protein deficiency" is only an imagined problem
* It makes intuitive sense - gorillas, our nearest neighbours, are tanks and they only eat fruit
* A vegan diet is naturally low in fat and processed foods - it is much easier to maintain a "healthy" vegan diet

Environment
* Plants are an order of magnitude more environmentally friendly than meat
* Livestock is one of greaters producers of methane, much larger than harmful emissions from cars
* Grain that could feed peolple instead feeds cows that then feed a much smaller number of people


Meh
* The chef will usually especially make you the best meal on the table if there's nothing on the menu
* A vegan diet isn't just cutting meat out of your diet. It's moving sideways. You'll discover awesome new foods.
* Vegans eat dessert. And you don't need an "egg replacement".
