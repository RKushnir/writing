Aug 2005: Try going vegetarian, lasts a week. Mostly cooked the same stuff sans-meat. FAIL.
Nov 2005: Go to a lecture by Peter Singer, cannot disagree, so become vegetarian. I knew one other vegetarian at this point.
Sep 2006: Go vegan for 30 days. Tried replacing yoghurt with soyghurt BAD MOVE. Did not know vegan desserts existed. Reverted after 30 days, but ate "more vegan".
Apr 2008: Go vegan for a 6-day hike, didn't feel like eating animal products after. Haven't since.
Jan 2008: Cut out bread and cereal for 30 days ("raw until dinner"). Reverted - expensive and you need to be on the ball with shopping habits - though eat a *lot* more fruit.

Lessons Learned:
- Slow progression. It's a shift sideways, rather than just cutting stuff out of your diet.
- I never ate chick peas, kidney beans, or lentils prior to going vege. Learn how to use them (and their friends).
- I consume a lot of soy via tofu and soy milk. Many find this screws them over, but it suits me.
- If you're not eating bread you need to eat a fuckton. Example day: http://gist.github.com/45394
- You eat much healthier by default going vegan, you can't snack on shit anymore (well you can, but you really have to try)
- When eating out, don't order off the menu, just ask for a vegan meal. 90% of the time the chef makes you something awesome.
- Get a blender. Smoothies/juices are the most awesome thing ever.

Other:
- I haven't drunk soft drink since 2005 either
- I never did agree with battery farming, but I didn't give a shit about animal rights until watching Earthlings and reading Animal Liberation in Jan 2008
