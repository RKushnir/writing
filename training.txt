Hello

There was bit of twitter interest in this today so here I am fleshing out the concept.

I'm thinking about running some professional training on database related topics, specifically aimed towards rails programmers. I don't see these issues talked about much in the ecosphere, probably because they can be hard, which is a shame because it's really important stuff for any commercial site.

Aside from my personal interest in the topic, I've dealt (and continue to deal!) with this topic a lot in industry, and feel it's stuff you really need to know as a professional developer.

In my experience the hairier topics can be difficult to grasp just from a lecture, so the format would be a combination of theory matched with practical rails examples, run over a couple of nights early in 2010, with notes and exercises and all that jazz to take home. I'd charge a couple hundred bucks, money back if you don't find it valuable.

Of course this is only worthwhile if people are interested in it. If that's you, please reply (privately if you wish) and I'll keep you in the loop. A few questions, if you'd be so kind:

1) How do these topics sound? Anything missing? Anything too mundane?
Data Integrity
- DB level constraints
- Key design
- App level concerns

Concurrency
- Locking
- optimistic vs pessimistic
- Isolation levels

DB Design
- Transactional vs Reporting DBs
- Performance considerations
- Data warehouses
- How to evaluate tech? MySQL? Postgresql? Oracle? CouchDB? Cognos?

2) Format OK? Would a weekend be better?
3) Would you prefer a different presenter? Am I too boring?
4) Could you bring your own laptop?
5) What city are you in?
