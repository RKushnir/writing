Tuesday
Arrived at hostel after midnight, 2 hour train from the airport. Group booking isn't until tomorrow, Jodie has sorted though. Run into her in lobby, get broccoli for dinner.

Wednesday
Staten island ferry with Jodie + Sean (random hostel guy from Sydney). The island itself, not very interesting, says dutch guy with stellar pants.

Thursday
Don't have tickets for the dance, go to a Jazz club with Jodie. Quality jazz, cocktails. Talk to old afro-american at the bar, and wannabe hip-hop artist behind it. Very NY. Kicked out, find another bar. Chimay Red ON TAP. Kicked out. Crazy guy talks to us on the street. Awoken at 6am, just after arriving home, because room booking has been screwed up. Jump around to RaTM in the hostel foyer.

Friday
The dancing! At Manhattan Centre, which is HUGE. Bands play into early hours.

Saturday
Slept until 4:30pm. 3 Big Bands at the dance, inc. George Gee. Then all bands playing together. Matt + I start a jam after close by singing C Jam.

Sunday
Boilermakers and Campus Five.

Monday
Went to Empire State Building. Sooooo touristly, felt dirty. Was awesome at the top though. Then beer tasting at random bar, including a divine coffee + chocolate stout.

Trombone band, small jazz combos. Best pianist ever. Matt declares party time in the AU corner. Random steal dances, shimmy offs, and arse grabs. Worldwide reputation for AU leads is "fun". Success! Few drinks before after party, get kicked out at bar close. Then to after party, hung around talking and drinking. Just danced with my 4 favorites, so good. This was the most fun night easily. Finished too early, went to diner. Home, still awake, toast, bed at 9am.

Tuesday
Went to Harlem with Matt and he bought a suit. I did not. Almost went to George Gee again but bailed at last moment for quiet night in. Fell asleep early, do not regret decision.
