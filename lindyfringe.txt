Hello, so I've been thinking about a swing event. I call it 'LindyFringe'.
It's not complete yet, but it's also not something I can't make work by myself.

LindyFringe is an event aimed at experienced dancers. It's main goal is inspiration. There are no workshops/teachers in the traditional sense - everyone is both a teacher and a student. It gives space to work on whatever you want - chorey, jams, styling - in collaboration with others. Also, people can share knowledge about dancing related topics that isn't necessarily steps/technique in more of a lecture format rather than on the dance floor (see below for examples).

Anyway here are some notes I've made:

= Background
This idea came from thinking about two successful weekend events we have on the coding scene:

== RubyFringe Conference
- Different from traditional ruby conferences (ruby is a programming language I use at work)
  - Focussed on speakers, not topics
  - People spoke about philosophy, jazz, lifestyle - anything that wasn't directly programming
  - Talks were more "here's how I think about" rather than "how to".

- Focus on getting attendees communicating
  - One stream, so everyone was in the same place
  - "Wife stream" - kept partners happy with tours so attendees didn't have to worry about them
  - Events outside of talks (parties)

== RailsCamp
- Informal, small event (~30 people)
- Let's just go somewhere for a weekend and hack on projects
- No internet
  - Forces communication, you need to ask questions

- Butcher paper schedule, sign yourself up for a presentation
- Non coding activities 
  - Guitar hero
  - Beer
  - Feeds back into coding (guitar hero scoreboard was made one camp)

- Spirit of cooperation, no 'teachers', everyone brings something to offer  

= LindyFringe (proposed)

Differences from coding events
- Hard to work on dance for hours at a time (unlike coding
- You can social dance for hours
  - But we have plenty of events for this
- Using space is harder, need more than just your laptop


Cool things
- Collaboration is particulary awesome, can encourage this
  - Chorey pong (I start with something simple, you morph it, then I morph it, etc...)
  - Mutant chorey (two group make up something to the same phrase, a third group merges the two togethers

- Workshops always presented in the context of a dance floor
  Miss out on some interesting 'non-core' topics - Peter's history talk in Perth was awesome

  Ideas just off the top of my head:
  - Xavier on rhythm
  - Xavier on memory
  - Xavier on fitness
  - Loz/Shob on chorey
  - Scott talking about anything
  - Claudia on dancing goals (she gave a similar thing at brats last year)
  - Matt/Keith on collecting music
  - Sarah/Anthony on praticising aerials
