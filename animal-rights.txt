Animals feel pain. This is beyond doubt. Furthermore, we know that causing pain to an animal is wrong.

When you see someone kick a dog, your moral instinct is outrage. We know intuitively that the dog feels pain. Imagine what you would feel if you hit a dog with your car. It's a traumatic experience. For the most part, we don't want to hurt animals. This conclusion - that animals feel pain - has further been comfirmed both scientifically and philosophically.



In general, though, the question of when it is wrong to kill (painlessly) an animal is one to which we need give no precise answer. As long as we remember that we should give the same respect to the lives of animals as we give to the lives of those human beings at a similar mental level we shall not go far wrong.

This is the classic position that most people are familiar with. It is that taken by pretty much all of the mainstream animal rights groups, including "PETA":http://www.peta.org/, "HSUS":http://www.hsus.org/ and "Animals Australia":http://www.animalsaustralia.org/.

A welfarist believes that cruelty to animals is unjustified, due to their capacity to suffer.
