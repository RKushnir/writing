Navigating the AMQP specification

Firstly, you need to figure out which version of the spec you need. As of this writing there are 4 versions - 0.8, 0.9.1, 0.10, and the 1.0 working draft. This wouldn't be a problem, except they're all pretty much different. 0.8 and 0.9 are similar enough that for simple stuff you can get away with just reading the 0.9 version - which is good because the 0.8 spec is a touch lacking. 0.9.1, though not exactly the same, is basically a tightening up of the 0.8 spec. 0.10 is quite different - it's a significant departure from the previous specifications, adding a new wire-level protocol and changes to message transfer semantics. As such, 0.10 is largely incompatible with 0.9. With all the new additions, 0.10 became quite complex - the aim of the 1.0 working draft is to simplify and tighten in up, much in the same way that 0.9.1 did.

RabbitMQ currently supports only 0.8 and 0.9. In fact, most implementors are skipping the 0.10 in anticipation of 1.0. Whenever you see talk of 'exchanges' this is 0.9 - the concept has been dropped in newer versions. For the rest of this document, I will be referring to the 0.9 spec.

The AMQP specifiction is presented in 3 components - the specification, the protocol documentation, and the protocol definitions in XML. If you already understand the fundamental concepts of AMQP (exchanges, queues, bindings, etc...), the interesting parts are section 2.2 AMQP Command Architecture which explains the sequence of commands between client and server, and section 2.3 Transport Architecture which details the specific byte level format of messages. I found it very instructive to get wire dumps (either using wireshark or by hacking the source) from an existing client - bunny/qrack was my choice.
