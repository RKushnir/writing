There is no such thing as a "Luxury" purchase. An outlay of money either increases your quality of life, of it doesn't. Discriminating between "necessary" and "luxury" goods fosters unhealthy attitudes and desires.

The first objection is semantic. There is no way to meaningfully separate the two categories. You are living above necessity now. You spend more money than is strictly "necessary".

Food is a necessity, right? What classifies as a luxury food? I buy organic, local produce where possible. It could be said that others don't have the "luxury" of being able to buy said food, but that can also be said of GMed
