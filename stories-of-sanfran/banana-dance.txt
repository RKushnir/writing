Late night on Sunday. A fresh shipment arrives of bananas - very welcome since we were too late for the first round of catering. Grechen and I are dancing. Also, we are hungry. 

We groove over to the table. You can find a lot of subdivisions in the beat when you're trying to get somewhere in a hurry. 

A pass by allows us each to aquire a morsel.

The problem with bananas is they need preparation. You know that hug where you hug with your elbows because you have bubbles all over your hands from doing the dishes and you don't feel they would be appreciated on someone else's back? Or chocolate, you could also have chocolate on your hands. That doesn't wash out so easy. Anyways, turns out that also frees up your hands for other activities. You can peel a banana, for instance. I won't say it's not just a little awkward, but you'll get the job done.

Eating is kind of fun. I mean, it is anyway. But next time you're eating a banana, throw a 360 turn in there. Look forward to sensory overload. You also need to be able to eat with your off-hand (left for me). A skill you may need to work at.

Another pass by allows easy disposable of the waste.

You know, these songs are a bit long. There's probably time for another banana.
