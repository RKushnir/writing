The day starts at powell st, 11:08am, with a woman pausing breifly mid way across market st to vomit milky white over the asphalt
we walk down to The Embarcadero to the farmers market
and buy peaches, rasberries and a raw vegan chocolate mousse with rasberry cheesecake for lunch
which we eat overlooking the bay bridge
which is big. Really big. Much bigger than the Golden Gate but no one cares.
too many people want to get on the F line to down to pier 39, so we walk to the previous stop to get on
the car fills up and it's peak hour at 1 o'clock saturday afternoon
we stay on until it turns around
and the impromptu plan is to tandem bike across golden gate
we don't dare ride the bike through traffic, so walk down to beach
a wobbly start and we're off!

first down to the hands at the base of the bridge, past the enviro globes
and we take turns impersonating the bridge
up the hill - blues festival on the left, book sale on the right
then onto and over the bridge
we fly down a bendy road, I wonder what the fastest tandem bike record is?
Up the other side, to old cement bunkers
and we take turns impersonating the sail boats - 
The longest yacht in the world is in the harbour
a futuristic pirate ship.
then on through the model village
to sausolito
another model village, but much much nicer
there's a dr suess exhibit at the gallery. And a Rembrant.
there's too many bikes on the ferry so we can't get on
instead Meaghan gets an icecream while we wait for the next
we sun on the ferry all the way to pier 1
then ride back to fisherman's wharf to drop of the bike
and Meagan buys a black suitcase with pink polka dots on it
would have caught a trolley back to the city but there isn't one so we get a bus
go to macey's to get my watch fixed
but the watch fixing department is closed
so go to find some dinner at cheesecake factory on the top floor
but there's a 2 hour wait so we go to find the chinese vegetarian place
which is west somewhere
and on the way we see a crowd dressed as pink bunnies
but we can't find it
so we wait far too long for thai noodles
and also thai curry
because we're hungry hungry hippos
we don't go out salsa dancing
instead home to bed
