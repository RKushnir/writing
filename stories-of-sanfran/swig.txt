There's a band playing at a bar called "Swig". They don't have a name, but they assemble every week (I'm told), give or take a few. Whoever has nothing better to do on a Sunday night. A large negro woman is up front, crying a blues.

Let's get funky. James Brown funky (RIP). The woman moves to back up vocals, a man takes the lead. He jumps on the dance floor and shakes his hips. Drops cross legged to the ground and corkscrews back up. Finds a woman to shake his hips at. Drops to the floor hovers around on his arms, like a salamander. 

Can we take it to the bridge?
Take it to the bridge.

His shirt becomes unbuttoned, revealing some tasty eye candy. Another lady becomes the target of his hip shaking. He does the splits. He does the splits the other way.

Let's hit it and quit.
Let's hit it and quit.
Hit it!

The woman and the guitarist walk around the bar with a tip jar, singing a soulful lullaby to send us on our way.
