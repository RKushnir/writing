There's a tap dancer on top of Powell St. Out in the sun, he's probably there everyday. All day, everyday. 
He wearing long shorts, no shirt - don't need no shirt - and sometimes a ____ hat. Catches his breath and then the music goes and he _goes_ and he's good and his dark skins glistens and sweats. The tourists lined up in circles for the Hyde/Powell trolley watch on through their HD videocams, $5 in hand keen to be robbed by the city of San Francisco. They can't quite see the drummer just around The Gap corner, but oh they can here him. Over turned buckets and water coolers, he bangs away and sings he's feeling Hot, Hot, Hot, and over the racket you can just hear an old man sawing away on a shimasen, lost among the circled lines and the tap and the drums.
