The roads through Golden Gate park are closed to cars on Sundays. Instead you'll find all sorts of greener alternatives - surf board long boards slaloming across all 4 lanes; roller blades with wheels bigger than your fist; scuffed pink roller skates below short cut-off denim and a faded purple singlet. Bikes of all shapes and sizes - two wheels, three, or four. Big wheels, small wheels. One of each. Just up the path and around the corner there's a lake, with dinghies and paddle boats for hire. Or you could just use your own two feet. 

The sun is out, melting icecreams.
