John "Broadway" Tucker wears big boots and a silver pinstripe suit. He's brooding the blues at the warehouse, and the whole warehouse is brooding with him. Soulful sorrows spread waves over our heads, thread ribbons through the couples, fill the entire space and you have no choice but to share this blues. He's down and he's out and his woman is no good and he sings with a heartache and desperation that's chasing the salvation you can only get by getting it out there. He stomps his boot and wrenches the microphone and the bass player is high. I'm looking at him - right in his eyes - and I'm digging him and he knows I'm digging him and he stomps his boot again and this time he's missing Chicago. Jim on the Soul Tub plonks away and he's lost in his own despairs but he plonks away anyways coz at least that's something else to keep your mind out of trouble.
